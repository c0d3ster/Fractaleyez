# Fractaleyez

Fractaleyez is a new way to visualize your music utilizing the beauty of mathematical fractals on a three.js canvas.
Fractaleyez puts you in control of your musical journey with the arrow keys controlling your speed and rotation and the mouse controlling your path of travel.
The interactive visualizer will run automatically without any music behind it.
Once you drop in an mp3 file and the file is analyzed, playback will begin and the visualizer responds to the beat of the music.
